# Project-2D

**Scientific question:**

WISP-1 is a protein from the CCN protein family which is known to act as an oncogene in most type of cancers to promote cancer cell proliferation, progression, metastasis, and invasion. What might be the structural basis of WISP-1-induced tumor growth?

**Scientific hypothesis:**

If WISP-1 can bind protein partners to activate signaling pathways like the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to modulate specific cell functions such as tumor cell proliferation, then there are structural domains on WISP-1 that engage in specific interactions with its binding partner β-catenin to promote tumorigenesis in colon cancer.

**Description of Data Files:**

_sequence.fasta_: contains the fasta files of the protein sequence of WISP-1 protein

how the data was downloaded:
- Search CCN family member 4 in NBCI within the protein category, select CCN family member 4 isoform 1 precursor [Homo sapiens]. The page should be https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NP_003873.1
- select “Send to” on the upper right corner, choose FASTA format, and click create file. Upload the “sequence.fasta” file downloaded to the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

_WISP1.ali_: manually created file containing the protein sequence of WISP-1 protein. Input into a txt file the target protein sequence (retrieved directly from sequence.fast) into the PIR format readable by MODELLER. Refer to Modeller tutorial for details of file format. https://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html. There are also general instruction for format within the Jupyter Notebook.



**Files containing code for Project 2D uploaded in .ipynb and .html-format.**
